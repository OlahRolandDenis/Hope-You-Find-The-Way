R: Hello, are you Dave's child?
You: Yes, it's me! I'm looking for the ingredients to make the potion my father invented.
R: For this, I'm going to have to send you to another world, are you ready?
You: But what will I need to do?
R: When you get there, you will have to collect letters from crabs and then sort the letters in ascending order.
To collect the letters from the crabs you will have to left click on the crab first for it to disappear.
Then, you will right click on the letter.
The letter you click on will be added in your inventory which you can toggle by pressing TAB on your keyboard.
When you got all the letters, a message will appear on the screen.
You will then open the inventory and click the button there to continue to the puzzle.
Nice hunting! :)
